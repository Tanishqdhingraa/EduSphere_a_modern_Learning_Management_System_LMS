How user will navigate and buy the course ? 
✅ How Purchase Flow Should Work
Step-1 User logs in
User gets JWT from User Service

Step-2 User clicks "Buy Course"
Frontend calls:
POST /orders/purchase
Authorization: Bearer <user-token>
Body: { courseId: "123" }
This request goes through API Gateway → Order Service

Step-3️ Order Service does the work
Order Service will:
Verify JWT (user identity)
Check course exists (call Course Service OR trust ID)
Create purchase record in its own DB

Final Flow
User → API Gateway → Order Service → Order DB
