How user will navigate and buy the course ? 
✅ How Purchase Flow Should Work
Step-1 User logs in
User gets JWT from User Service

Step-2 User clicks "Buy Course"
Frontend calls:
POST /orders/purchase
Authorization: Bearer <user-token>
Body: { courseId: "123" }
This request goes through API Gateway → Order Service

Step-3️ Order Service does the work
Order Service will:
Verify JWT (user identity)
Check course exists (call Course Service OR trust ID)
Create purchase record in its own DB

Final Flow
User → API Gateway → Order Service → Order DB
                         ↓
                    (optional REST call)
                         ↓
                   Course Service
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How order purchase service get to know about the new course added ? 

Admin creates course
        ↓
Course Service DB save
        ↓
Publishes "course.created"
        ↓
Order Service receives event
        ↓
Stores course snapshot locally
        ↓
User buys course
        ↓
Order Service creates purchase
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Webhooks Implementations 

User buys course → Stripe payment page → Payment success
→ Stripe sends webhook → Your Order Service verifies it
→ You mark course as purchased in DB
→ Publish event to RabbitMQ → Notification service sends email


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frontend → API Gateway → Order Service → Stripe
Stripe → Webhook → Order Service → DB save
Order Service → RabbitMQ → Notification Service
